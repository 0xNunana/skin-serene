## Understanding Your Skin Type

Knowing your skin type is the first step towards a healthier complexion. Is it oily, dry, combination, or sensitive?

### Natural Ingredients for Radiance

*   **Vitamin C:** Found in citrus fruits, brightens skin.
*   **Rosehip Oil:** Rich in antioxidants, promotes cell regeneration.
*   **Aloe Vera:** Soothes and hydrates.

## Daily Skincare Routine

1.  **Cleanse:** Use a gentle, natural cleanser. Our Pure Bliss Handmade Soap is a great option.
2.  **Tone:** Apply a toner to balance pH.
3.  **Serum:** Target specific concerns with a potent serum.
4.  **Moisturize:** Hydrate with a natural moisturizer like our Radiant Glow Body Lotion or Velvet Smooth Face Cream.
5.  **Sunscreen:** Protect your skin from UV damage.

Stay consistent, and you'll see results!

## Why Body Oils?

Body oils provide deep hydration and can lock in moisture more effectively than some lotions.

### Key Benefits:

*   **Intense Moisturization:** Oils penetrate deeply to nourish dry skin.
*   **Improved Skin Barrier:** Help to strengthen the skin's natural barrier.
*   **Enhanced Glow:** Leave skin looking luminous and healthy. Our Serene Night Body Oil is perfect for this.
*   **Relaxation:** Many oils, like lavender, offer aromatherapeutic benefits.

## How to Use Body Oils

Apply to damp skin after a shower or bath for best absorption. A few drops are usually enough.
